                This is a simulation of the foosball game.
                You play against the computer in five different levels.
                You will progress to the next level only if you win the previous level.
                You will be declared as the winner if you clear all the levels.
                
                Your side will be on the left side of the screen so, you need to score on the right goal post.
                You can move your players using 'up' and 'down' arrow keys or by using 'w' and 's' key.
